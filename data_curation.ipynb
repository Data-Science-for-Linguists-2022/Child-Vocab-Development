Additionally, I will need the participant information (i.e. child age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES), mother's education) and some basic annotations of the words (i.e. morphemes and lexical categories). Participant information can be found in the header of each CHAT file as the metadata of the file. Annotation information can be found as dependent tiers embedded in the transcription.\n",
